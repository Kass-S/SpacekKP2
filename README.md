created a webpage with three diffrent pages, each containing different information

peer reviewed by Karen Cadavos - I appreciate the cohesive colors of the buttons and the backgrounds. Great use of the accordion feature. I would suggest adding comments on pages that are information heavy (Accomplishments / interests) to get a better understanding of what specific divs are containing.
